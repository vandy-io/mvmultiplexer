This project explores alternate forms of encryption and data compression through custom byte codes and mathematical dictionary-based techniques.

Highlights:
Data Compression: The system utilizes mathematical methods to reduce payload sizes, optimizing data transfer efficiency.
Encryption: By applying unique encoding techniques, it creates secure, alternate representations of data.
Scalable Design: Built for extensibility, supporting various dimensional formats and encoding strategies.
I believe this concept could complement efforts in data optimization, particularly in areas requiring efficient communication protocols (e.g., satellite communication, autonomous vehicle networks).

Thank you for considering my work. Please feel free to reach out for further discussions or collaboration.
